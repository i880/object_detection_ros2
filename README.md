# **ROS 2 Object Detection with YOLOv8** 🚀

Welcome to the **ROS 2 Object Detection** project! This repository demonstrates how to perform real-time object detection using **YOLOv8** in a **ROS 2** environment. Whether you're a robotics enthusiast, a computer vision developer, or just curious about AI-powered object detection, this project is for you!

---

## **Features** ✨

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Detect objects in real-time using a camera feed.
- **YOLOv8 Integration**: Leverage the power of YOLOv8, one of the fastest and most accurate object detection models.
- **ROS 2 Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrate object detection into your ROS 2 workflows.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt the code to detect custom objects or use different YOLO models.
- **Visualization**: Display bounding boxes and labels directly on the camera feed.

## **Getting Started** 🛠️

### **Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **ROS 2** (tested on Humble or Rolling)
- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenCV**
- **Ultralytics YOLOv8** (`pip install ultralytics`)

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/i880/object_detection_ros2.git
   cd object_detection_ros2
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Build the ROS 2 package:
   ```bash
   colcon build --packages-select object_detection_ros2
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

---

## **Usage** 🚦

1. **Run the Object Detection Node**:
   Launch the object detection node:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch object_detection_ros2 object_detection.launch.py
   ```

2. **View the Results**:
   - The detected objects will be displayed in a live camera feed.
   - The names of detected objects are published to the `/detected_object_name` topic.

3. **Customize the Model**:
   Replace the default YOLOv8 model (`yolov8n.pt`) with your custom-trained model:
   ```python
   self.model = YOLO("path/to/your/model.pt")
   ```
